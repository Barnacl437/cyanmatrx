# cyanmatrx

cool and clean (i guess) firefox theme. 

took lots of codes from [alan-ar1's greenyfox](https://github.com/alan-ar1/greenyfox) and made it more readable (and usable imo).

it's just cyan monospace texts and deep dark background around in my head. feel free to *get involved*. Expect future updates as i'm still trying to mess around with this.

bored reading? yeah i ran outta words too, some prtscn-s below:
